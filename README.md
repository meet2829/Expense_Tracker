Step-by-step data flow (detailed)

Typing in the form
Each input onChange calls setFormData({ ...FormData, field: value }).
This updates component state only (local to AddExpenseForm).

Submit (HandleSubmit)
e.preventDefault() prevents page reload.
You read User (set by onAuthStateChanged) — if not logged in you early return.
You dispatch(addExpense({...FormData, amount: FormData.amount, createdAt: new Date()})).
This updates Redux (optimistic update). Good for UX, but you must handle possible Firestore failure/rollback.
You await addDoc(collection(db, "users", User.uid, "expenses"), {...FormData, amount: FormData.amount, createdAt: new Date()}).
This writes to Firestore. Firestore generates an id for the doc.

Realtime updates
If you have an onSnapshot listener (typical pattern) on users/{uid}/expenses, Firestore sends the latest list; your listener should dispatch a setExpenses (or similar) action that replaces the Redux state with authoritative data from Firestore (including doc ids). This makes the UI consistent with the DB and resolves optimistic-update mismatches.

Rendering / Passing data
A parent component (e.g., Expenses page) or ExpensesList reads expenses from Redux via useSelector(state => state.expenses.items) and passes that array as props to SpendingPieChart, MonthlyBarChart, ExpenseLineChart, CategoryBarChart, and ExpensesList itself.
Charts take expenses and compute aggregated arrays for rendering (your reduce code). React re-renders charts when expenses changes.




Overview (one-liner)
User fills the form → local component state updates → on submit we optimistically update Redux and write to Firestore → a realtime Firestore listener (onSnapshot) writes authoritative data back to Redux → UI reads Redux and re-renders charts & lists.

Step-by-step (simple & clear)
1. Typing in the form
Each input uses onChange to update local component state:

setFormData({ ...FormData, field: value })
This state is local to AddExpenseForm until the user submits.

2. Submitting the form (HandleSubmit)
Prevent default form behavior:
e.preventDefault()

If the user is not logged in, return early.
Prepare the payload (convert amount to number, add timestamps if needed).
Optimistic update: dispatch to Redux immediately so UI feels fast:
dispatch(addExpense({ ...payload, createdAt: new Date() }))


Write to Firestore (server persists the data and generates the document id):
await addDoc(collection(db, "users", User.uid, "expenses"), payload)

On success: clear the form.
On failure: show an error and optionally rollback the optimistic Redux update.

3. Realtime sync (authoritative source)
A single onSnapshot listener on users/{uid}/expenses keeps your app in sync:
    Firestore pushes changes (add/edit/delete).
    The listener maps documents and dispatches:

dispatch(setExpenses(listFromSnapshot))
This makes Redux the authoritative client-side state (includes real doc ids).

4. Rendering & data flow to UI
Parent page (e.g., Expenses.js) reads Redux once:

const expenses = useSelector(state => state.expenses.items ?? [])


Parent can either:
Pass expenses as props to child components (recommended for reusable charts), or
Let child components read from Redux directly using useSelector.
Charts and lists compute aggregates from expenses and re-render automatically when Redux updates.


Quick sequence (compact)
User types → FormData (local state).
Submit → dispatch(addExpense(…)) (optimistic).
Submit → addDoc(...) to Firestore (persists).
Firestore onSnapshot → dispatch(setExpenses(snapshotData)) (authoritative).
UI (useSelector) re-renders charts/lists.
